# Hi friends!
This is a project I worked on throughout the fall of 2024 in college. It's a clone of the game *Zork*, an old text-based adventure game. It's designed to run entirely in the command line, and supports custom dungeons and adventures!
This was a cumulative project that spanned the entire semester, with a total of five different versions of the project.
I learned all about object-oriented design while working on this throughout the semester. we learned about how to use UML documentation, function scopes, encapsulation, and more!
It was also a collaborative effort, and the project taught me a lot about working on a team. I took the lead throughout the project, delegating tasks and outlining feature design.
Overall, I'm very proud of the work I've done on this project. Feel free to download the project and poke around it!
## Additionally, it's still fully playable! Here are the instructions to get it running:
1. download the project and enter ./src
2. run this code 
   ```javac *.java```
   ```java ../files/sampleDungeon.zork```
